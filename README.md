## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not in the App Store?**  
> Because publishing apps cost money, and I’d rather **HODL** my crypto.

1. Download and unzip **`CryptoTicker.zip`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/AttackOnMorty/crypto-ticker/releases).
2. Move **CryptoTicker** to your **Applications** folder.
